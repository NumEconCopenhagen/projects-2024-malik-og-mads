# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Effect of Savings in a Solow Model**. We want to show the effects the savings rate has on physical capital in a Solow Model. Later on we extend our model and add human capital. We want to see if there still is a positive correlation between the savings rate and physical and human capital.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) and [modelproject.py](modelproject.py).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
